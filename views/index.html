          This is the start of a website that will allow users to connect and explore in real-time. 
          The lobbying system is currenty in progress. After perfecting this, we plan on implementing a 
          text-based adventure in which players may discuss with each other and vote for different choices. 
          Squad Linkup will constantly be improved as our coding knowledge increases, hopefully becoming a full-fledged, production-quality game in the future. 
          For example, it is expected that MongoDB will be implemented shortly so that users may be able to continue their games after leaving the site.

          <strong>Patch Notes:</strong><br>
          v0.0.1 - August 11, 2017<br>
          New rooms are visible under "Join an existing room", although no feedback is given when "Make new room" is pressed, and are updated amongst all clients in real-time. Currently, joining a room is not yet implemented - all creates rooms have a occupancy of 1 because the server considers every new room made to contain the user which created it.
          <br>
          v0.0.2 - August 11, 2017<br>Minor styling updates
          <br>v0.0.3 - August 12, 2017<br>Fixed a bug where the loop for adding rooms to available array in server continued forever.
